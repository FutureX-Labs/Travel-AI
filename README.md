## Introduction
The Travel-AI project consists of both frontend and backend components. The backend, which is the focus of this document, facilitates communication between users and the system, handling queries related to flights, accommodation, and travel planning.

## Setup
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/FutureX-Labs/Travel-AI.git`
2. Navigate to the backend directory: `cd backend`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the server: `npm start`

## Technologies Used
- React: Frontend framework
- Express: Backend framework for handling API requests
- SQL: Database management system for storing data
- Node.js: JavaScript runtime for executing backend code
